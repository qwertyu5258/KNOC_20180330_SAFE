The name, Sunshine, reflects the company¡¯s identity as a public energy provider. An example of this is heating expense assistance in the form of provision of briquettes and oil product gift cards. Households whose energy bills exceed 10% of their income can benefit from the program. The project is financed with donations from employees and the same amount of money granted by the company. Besides heating expense assistance, KNCO provides poor populations with rice before important national holidays and kimchi before the winter season starts. Also, the company provides support for home improvements, including repair of boilers and medical services in cooperation with external organizations.</td>

Other such efforts include support for community road construction in Iraq, support for the Petroleum Institute of Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, medical service in Kazakhstan, and provision of medicines and medical equipment for the local communities near Block 4 in Yemen. There are also programs for families of diverse cultural backgrounds at home. KNOC helps them pass the Korean language test and invite children of such families to a company tour, extracurricular camps, and study trips to historic or cultural places.</td>
