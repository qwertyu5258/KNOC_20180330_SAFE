												In an environment where competition among countries to secure energy resources is more intense than ever, KNOC is striving to contribute to the development of Korea's economy as a national corporation and to grow into an internationally trusted company.<br/><br/>
												Ethical management and corporate social responsibilities are the demands of the times as well as the obligation of all companies. It has become an important corporate management activity necessary to ensure continuous business.<br/><br/>
												In recognition of the need for securing reasonable profitability, meeting the level of global leading companies, and operating systematic ethical management, KNOC reorganized its ethics charter and code of conduct. KNOC also introduced a diversity of training and evaluation programs to create a corporate culture where management and employees can voluntarily participate in ethical management. These endeavors enable our employees to conduct their jobs under ethical standards and reasonable procedures, and help the company fulfill its social responsibilities.<br/><br/>
												Rather than becoming complacent with what we have already accomplished, KNOC will continue to work at achieving ethical management at a world-class level.

															<td align="left">Enron, a large US energy company known for its sound performance, fell overnight in the wake of a fraudulent accounting scandal. Since then, corporate ethics and ethical management have emerged as important global standards for corporate management.<br /><br />
															At home, public calls have increased for better ethical management since the 1997 currency crisis and SK Global¡¯s accounting scandal in 2003. Diverse rules and regulations have been strengthened as a result. In addition, an increasing number of people now recognize that meeting social responsibilities is a significant corporate obligation. Against this backdrop, companies are adopting ethical management policies and systems.<br /><br />
															KNOC is no exception. The company considers ethical management not a mere tool for management, but an important mode of management that can enhance its organizational structure and operations. With the belief that ethical management is a value that should be shared among all members, employees of the company are actively engaged in related activities.<br /><br />
															Corporations that do not understand Ethical Management and its worth will no longer be able to survive in today's corporate world. A corporation must arm itself with ethics for long term survival. In today¡¯s corporate environment, one cannot survive without firm ethical management principles and a solid base of trust. To survive, companies must fully adopt values of ethical management.<br /><br />
															Ethical management is not a one-time fad. It will be entrenched as a long-term trend of business management.</td>
