						level and expanded its overseas strongholds to the North Sea and Africa.<br />
						Meanwhile, KNOC is consolidating the business foundation with efficient management of local
						and overseas oil & gas blocks. The Corporation has been producing natural gas and condensate
						from a domestic continental shelf, Donghae-1 gas field, located 58 kilometers offshore Ulsan
						and found additional gas and oil in Vietnam 11-2 and 15-1 blocks. KNOC has also built sound
						international relations with national oil companies in Asia and oil producing countries.<br /><br />
						
						In April 2010, KNOC took a landmark step in its history, completing oil stockpile plan
						according to 3-phases of government oil stockpile plan that started from 1980.<br />
						Having completed the Korean government¡¯s stockpiling plan, starting in Ulsan city in 1980,
						KNOC has secured a storage capacity of 146 million barrels. It is equivalent to 158 days of net
						imports, at nine bases throughout the country.<br />
						KNOC plans to establish global trading system with increased trading of overseas-produced
						oil and makes efforts to stabilize oil supply and demand at home by lending reserved oil and
						oil facilities to local refineries in time.
