	                      As a result, total sales of gas  from Rong Doi could reach USD 3.3 billion with a  gross profit of USD 1.8 billion over the next 23 years.

	                    <td>KNOC purchased a 100% stake in BlackGold oil sands fields of Alberta,  Canada, in July 2006, marking the first time Korea has extracted oil from sand.  Oil sands, a non-traditional crude oil called as bitumen oil, are a semi-solid  form of crude oil. The bitumen, which surrounds micro particles of sand,  constitute from 6 to 17% of total oil sands by weight.<br />
	                      Since oil sands are buried too  deeply in the subsurface for open-pit mining, in situ techniques were developed  to recover them. Using advanced drilling technology, steam is injected into the  deposit to heat the oil sand and lower the viscosity of the bitumen. Using this  method, we are able to combine mining and bitumen extraction into one  procedure, thereby improving productivity.<br />
	  With record-breaking oil prices  over the last three years and downturns in North Sea oil production,  international oil companies have begun focusing on oil sands development.<br />
	  The BlackGold oil sands development is  meaningful in terms of its economic value, particularly with oil currently  trading at USD 35 to 40 per barrel in North America. KNOC plans to begin  construction of full-scale production facilities in 2008, producing up to  35,000 barrels of oil per day by 2010, while generating an estimated annual  revenue of USD 0.5 billion, making it the nation¡¯s largest oil production  project according to investment ratio.</td>
