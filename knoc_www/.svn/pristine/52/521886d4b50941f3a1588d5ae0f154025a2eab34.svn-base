													<p>Reservoir simulation is one of the core technologies in the domain of petroleum engineering to form optimal development/production operation strategies, future production forecast and reserve estimation as the computer-based modeling method for reservoir description in the 3-Dimension.</p>
													<br />
													<p>High-risk investment is required for reservoir development and production because it is always associated with uncertainties about geological characteristics and high risk of development/production operation, which means difficulties in reservoir restoration and cost recovery in case of inefficient reservoir development/production. Reservoir simulation, which is a very useful technology for the economical development in oil and gas fields, enables to test various situations to predict and prevent the high risks and present optimal development/production operation strategies.</p>
													<br />
													<p>EPTI, the predecessor of Technology Development department, conducted reservoir simulation for Block 11-2 of Vietnam in 2008 to verify the development feasibility. The institute proposed the optimal field development strategy for Ada in Kazakhstan by executing a simulation study in 2009, 2010, and 2012. Both of a DFN(Discrete Fracture Network) model construction and simulation study with EOR were also done for a fractured reservoir of San Pedro in Peru and a heavy oil reservoir of Hayter in Canada. Technology Development department has taken over EPTI¡¯s task in 2016 and been conducting unconventional reservoir simulation study and technical supports for horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing methods applied reservoirs which are Montney in Canada and Eagle Ford in USA.</p>
