										<h4 style="margin-bottom:15px;"><img src="../images/sub06/sub06_2_n5_img01.gif" alt="Heavy Oil Production" /></h4>
										<div style="text-align:justify;margin-left:18px;margin-bottom:25px;">
											<p>Heavy oil is defined as petroleum of less than 22¡Æ API. Oil with API gravity of 10¡Æ or less is classified as extra heavy oil and oil sands (or bitumen). Heavy oil is easier to extract than other unconventional oil resources. However, it is still difficult to produce, transport, and process compared to conventional crude oil. The world¡¯s heavy oil reserves in place are estimated at 6 trillion barrels. Despite the huge amount, the recovery rate stands at only 10% due to high density and viscosity. Therefore, to extract heavy oil, enhanced oil recovery techniques are required. One of the main such techniques is thermal injection, which injects steam or hot water into reservoirs to lower viscosity. Chemical injection uses dilute solutions to lower viscosity. Multilateral horizontal wells are also used to increase the surface area in contact with heavy oil.</p><br />
											<p>Development of heavy oil has accelerated globally due to high oil prices since 2007. KNOC has also expanded its business scope to heavy oil. Such efforts include development of oil sands in BlackGold, Canada, acquisition of Harvest Energy of Canada, and exploration of CPE-7 in Colombia.</p><br />
											<p>In line with this, the company has striven to secure enhanced technologies for heavy oil production through efforts like sharing production knowhow with Harvest. Research also has been promoted. Steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) and other tertiary technologies have been simulated in BlackGold in 2007-2008. For the next two years, KNOC and Fukuoka University of Japan conducted a joint study on the feasibility of thermal production technologies at the CPE-7 exploration block in Colombia. To facilitate the study, the two signed a memorandum of understanding. Also, the company simulated EOR methods to see what¡¯s feasible for the Hayter heavy oil assets of Harvest at the end of 2009. This was followed by studies on lower aquifer control and horizontal well optimization.</p><br />
											<p>KNOC¡¯s efforts regarding heavy oil production, its next growth engine, are focused on raising production efficiency and lowering costs. Strong production capability for heavy oil with a high potential will lay the foundation for KNOC to grow into the world¡¯s top national oil company.</p>

										<h4 style="margin-bottom:15px;"><img src="../images/sub06/sub06_2_n5_img02.gif" alt="Oil Sands Exploration and Production" /></h4>
										<div style="text-align:justify;margin-left:18px;margin-bottom:25px;">
											<p>Oil sands are natural mixtures of sand, clay, water, and bitumen. These mixtures are so dense and viscous that techniques like injecting steam and solvents are used to lower viscosity to develop and produce oil sands. Oil sands are found all around the world, but they are heavily deposited in Athabasca, Canada and the Orinoco Belt, Venezuela. KNOC bought the BlackGold oil sand assets in Canada in 2006. Development and production have been conducted since then.</p><br />
											<p>Since 2007, KNOC has performed studies on enhanced recovery, exploration, and feasibility of development of not only oil sands, but bitumen in unconventional carbonates, which is regarded as a future energy source. The study was assigned by the Korea government.</p><br />
											<p>KNOC has also conducted a study on SAGD and enhanced SAGD to recover bitumen held in shallow oil layers in BlackGold more efficiently. The results will help the company improve its recovery in shallow oil sands. Another study is also underway for qualitative and quantitative assessment of bitumen in unconventional carbonates. The goal of the study is to test the feasibility of exploration and development of bitumen.</p>

										<h4 style="margin-bottom:15px;"><img src="../images/sub06/sub06_2_n5_img03.gif" alt="Shale and Tight Gas" /></h4>
										<div style="text-align:justify;margin-left:18px;margin-bottom:25px;">
											<p>Shale gas is natural gas trapped in shale formations which contain organic matter. Gas which left in a free state in the source rock is extracted. In the past, collection of shale gas did not make economic sense due to the low permeability of shale formations. Today, however, commercial production has become viable thanks to horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing which has improved the permeability.</p><br />
											<p>Tight gas is trapped in reservoirs, which consist of clay sediments or are under high pressure. The traps are generally huge and characterized by very low porosity. Artificial fracturing is thus required to extract the gas.</p><br />
											<p>KNOC strives to secure advanced technologies for exploration, development, and production of shale gas and tight gas. In June 2011, it launched a technology development project under assignment from the Korean government. The project is focused on assessment of the quantity of resources in shale gas plays and development of exploration technology for earlier entry into prospective assets overseas. For this, KNOC operates an exclusive department and keeps up with the latest technologies.</p>

										<h4 style="margin-bottom:15px;"><img src="../images/sub06/sub06_2_n5_img04.gif" alt="GTL Technology" /></h4>
										<div style="text-align:justify;margin-left:18px;margin-bottom:25px;">
											<p>The gas-to-liquid (GTL) process converts natural gas to liquid hydrocarbons through the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis.</p><br />
											<p>The GTL process consists of synthetic gas production, FT synthesis, and upgrading. The main products of the process are high quality petroleum products such as gasoline, naphtha, and diesel. These are clean liquid fuels which hardly emit pollutants like NOx and SOx and thus can be utilized as a refinery blendstock. Also, since the GTL products¡¯ properties are the same as those of conventional fuels, the existing refinery market¡¯s infrastructure can be used.</p><br />
											<p>KNOC has conducted a government-funded study project since 2006 through the GTL consortium which consists of other public corporation, state-funded research institutes, and private companies. The consortium constructed and successfully operated a 0.1 barrels per day (bpd) mini plant in the first stage in 2006-2009. In the second stage in 2009-2012, it completed construction of a 1 bpd pilot plant in 2011. Operation of the plant is now underway. The basic design package for a 100 bpd demonstration plant will be completed within this year based on data from the pilot plant. </p>
