									<div style="width:720px;text-align:justify;margin-bottom:30px;">
										<p>Due to high oil prices, enhanced oil recovery (EOR) processes have emerged as useful methods for recovery of oil and gas from wells which primary or secondary processes were used for. Generally, the EOR methods are classified into miscible, immiscible, thermal, and bacterial techniques. CO2 or nitrogen flooding is miscible; polymer or alkaline surfactant polymer (ASP) flooding is immiscible; and steam injection and burning gas are thermal.</p><br />
										<p>The EOR methods are mostly related with reduction of residual oil saturation or oil viscosity and lowering of interfacial tension between oil and water. EPTI has strived to acquire diverse EOR technologies for years. The institute collaborated with world-renowned research institutes for further study into CO2 injection. KNOC¡¯s acquisition of oil companies with non-conventional or old oil and gas assets allowed the institute to benefit from their accumulated knowledge and knowhow. Now, the institute is involved in a study of steam injection, polymer flooding, etc. to enhance recovery in Hayter and Chauvin in Canada. Another study, which is now underway, looks into production after the steam assisted gravity drainage process.</p><br />
										<p>EOR technologies are necessary for Korea to increase independent development of oil and gas wells, which will pave the way towards its emergence as an energy powerhouse.</p>
