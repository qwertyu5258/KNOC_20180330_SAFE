													<p>Doo Sung is Korea's only semi-submersible drilling unit built in 1984 by Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering (DSME). So far, the ship has drilled boreholes not only in Korea, but also in Alaska, China, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Russia. The number of successfully drilled boreholes reached 121 as of June 30, 2016.</p><br />
													<p>To meet increasingly complicated safety requirements from operators, Doo Sung acquired safety certifications from International Safety Management (ISM) and ISO 9001 in 1998 and the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (ISPS) in 2004.</p><br />
													<p>Aggressive health, safety, environmental, and quality efforts regarding Doo Sung have borne fruit on several fronts. In September 2015. Doo Sung recorded its 8th consecutive year of accident-free operation. This achievement, certified by the International Association of Drilling Contractors (IADC), was an opportunity to demonstrate the ship¡¯s high level of safety and superb operational capability on the international stage. In addition, improvement of the hull of the ship was completed a year earlier, further raising the ship¡¯s operational safety and competitiveness.</p><br />
													<p>High safety and efficiency are the two main operational goals of Doo Sung. To meet these goals, KNOC will do its best based on its state-of-the art equipment, abundant knowhow, and experienced human resources.</p>
