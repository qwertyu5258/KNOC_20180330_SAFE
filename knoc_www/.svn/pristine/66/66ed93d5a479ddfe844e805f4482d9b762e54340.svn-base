<p>Creating Value Beyond Energy</p><br />

<p>Thank you for visiting KNOC's homepage.</p><br />

<p>Korea National Oil Corporation (KNOC) was founded in 1979 to help stabilize Korea's national economy by ensuring a stable supply of energy even during an oil crisis through strategic petroleum stockpiling and development.</p><br />

<p>Since its foundation, KNOC has built nine underground and aboveground oil stockpiling bases with the total capacity reaching 146 million barrels.</p><br />

<p>At home, the company began producing natural gas in the Donghae-1 field in 2004, finally realizing Korea's long-standing goal of becoming an oil producing country.</p><br />

<p>The company maintains extensive technology and knowhow for oil exploration, development, and production. Based on this, KNOC operates projects in 21 countries around the world, which include oil fields in the North Sea and shale gas fields in North America. Total reserves now reach 1.3 billion barrels and daily production, 210,000 barrels.</p><br />

<p>Underneath the Northeast Asia Oil Hub project, KNOC has built commercial oil storage facilities. The project is aimed at nurturing Korea into the regional center for oil trading, distribution, and related financial transactions. This effort, a part of the Korean government's Creative Economy Initiative in energy, is expected to create added value and jobs.</p><br />

<p>KNOC has grown with the trust and love of the Korean people. Therefore, we at KNOC will do our best to contribute to the Korean society, establish fair trade practices, and realize the accompanied growth of the company's smaller partners and local communities.</p><br />

<p>KNOC was recognized as the most trustworthy public corporation in 2013 and 2014 two years in a low. With this in mind, we promise to develop the company that fulfills the public's trust and expectations. We ask for your continuous interest and support. Thank you.</p><br />

<p>President &amp; CEO<br />
Jung Rae Kim</p>
