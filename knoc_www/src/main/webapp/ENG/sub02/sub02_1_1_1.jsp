													<p><strong>¡Ü Enhancing Management Ethics to Global Standards</strong><br /><br />In recognition of the needs for securing reasonable profitability, meeting the level of global leading companies, and operating systematic ethical management, KNOC established the Global Business Ethics Strategy for Top (B.E.S.T.) performance as its strategic goal for ethical management. To achieve the goal, KNOC has not only reorganized the ethics charter and code of conduct but has also strived to form a company-wide consensus through the development of unique ethical management programs, a circuit of ethical education at home and abroad, and a quiz contest on the code of conduct. Its overseas branches are also very active in joining ethical management. Such endeavors enable employees to conduct their jobs under ethical standards and reasonable procedures, and help the company fulfill its social responsibilities.</p><br /><br />
	
													<p><strong>¡Ü Contributing to Society at Home and Abroad</strong><br /><br />To realize our vision, "A World-class National Oil Corporation Beloved by the People," KNOC is committed to implementing social contribution activities reflecting its business features and social demands. These programs include Sunshine to assist residents with heating expenses, Happy Together to aid rural villages during the farming season and support the education of children from low-income families, and Hopeful Energy to provide scholarships for the cultivation of talents dedicated to the E &amp; P sector. To expand our global businesses and support the educational environment of overseas local residents, and improve the infrastructure of their community, we actively operate Global KNOC Family.</p><br /><br />
	
													<p><strong>¡Ü Enhancing Safety</strong><br /><br />With the operation of an integrated health, safety, environment, and quality (HSEQ) management system meeting global standards, KNOC is taking the initiative in promoting a safe business environment. Each worksite focuses on improving the HSE management level through sharing knowhow and best practices and holding HSE conferences as well as enhancing training against accidents. As a result of such efforts, our stockpiling bases have remained both accident- and disaster-free for 11 consecutive years.</p><br /><br />
	
													<p><strong>¡Ü Enhancing National Energy Security</strong><br /><br />Since its foundation in 1979, KNOC has been playing a pivotal role in national economic development by engaging in a variety of exploration and development projects at home and abroad, oil stockpiling, and improvement in oil distribution networks under a mission to deliver hope and convenience to the public through the stabilization of energy supplies.<br /><br />
													To lay the foundation for its sustainable growth, KNOC will continue to focus on developing technologies to improve exploration success rates as well as enhance management capabilities through additional oil stockpiles and increase efficiency of managing global assets in the future. By doing so, KNOC will play a leading role in both the expansion of national self-sufficiency capabilities and the stabilization of energy supplies.</p>
