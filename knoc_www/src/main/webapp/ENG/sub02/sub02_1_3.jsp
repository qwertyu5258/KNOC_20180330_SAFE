A total  of 24 entities including state-owned energy companies, resource developers and  suppliers are sharing research and exchanging information. KOEDPS is playing a  leading role in activating Korea¡¯s overseas energy development.<br />
	                      This joint approach to overseas  expansion, which draws together resource developers and heavy-industry giants,  enables Korea to offer oil-producing countries an attractive &quot;package  solution&quot; that may include road and power-generation plant construction  along with traditional E&amp;P operations. Applying this strategy, KNOC  overcame formidable latecomer disadvantages to enter Nigeria in search of  niche-market opportunities for overseas expansion.<br />
	                      For instance, KNOC secured two  large-scale deepwater oilfields in Nigeria along with a USD 10 billion railroad  modernization project partnering with POSCO and KEPCO.<br />
	                      This joint  approach is proving to be an effective strategy for overseas oil exploration,  and we expect it will increasingly enable Korea to combine its strengths in  power generation facilities and plant construction to counter rising  competition from China and India, which are utilizing their ample capital to  develop natural resources.</td>
