						The efficient management of local and overseas blocks brought KNOC a meaningful
						result: production augmentation. KNOC has secured additional production volume after
						additional discovery of oil and gas at Vietnam 11-2 and 15-1 blocks and succeeded
						in pilot drilling while evaluating exploration potential on a block in Egypt.<br /> In addition,
						the company's construction of production facilities has continued on schedule for the
						BlackGold oil sands block in Canada and has completed its production facilities for the
						ADA Block in Kazakhstan.<br />
						KNOC has expanded new business opportunities by reinforcing international cooperation
						ties by hosting the Asian NOC CEO Forum successfully and seeking cooperation with oil &
						gas production countries such as Australia, Russia, Venezuela and Iraq.

	               		After finding the Donghae-1 gas field on Block VIII in the deep waters of the East Sea,
						KNOC and Woodside, which has an extensive experience of deep water exploration,
						jointly applied deep water explorative play to find drilling structure and location,
						enhancing deepwater explorative techniques and self-dependant rate.<br />
						KNOC's domestic continental shelf development projects have yielded a set of
						comprehensive E&P technologies including drilling, development and production.<br />
						With these technologies, KNOC is revitalizing additional exploration both at home and
						abroad. KNOC plans to secure 100 million barrels of oil and gas resources through 20
						exploratory drilling campaigns over the next ten years according to The First Domestic
						Offshore E&P Master Plan(2009~2018), established in February 2009. To this end,
						KNOC will focus on exploring deep-sea areas ranging from 300 to 3,000 meters which
						are emerging as promising resources as well as developing the domestic shallow
						continental shelf at depths up to 200 meters. Meanwhile, KNOC will carry out joint
						oil system researches with a Japanese private oil company for Joint Development
						Zone(JDZ), uplifting its exploration capability to the next level.

						KNOC established a mid- and long-term roadmap on rig business expansion in phases

						will focus on upgrading Doo Sung, securing additional 2 rigs rated to 5,000ft, including

						from newly obtained blocks overseas thanks to the expansion strategy. During 2010, it
						acquired 980 thousand barrels (617 barrels from Harvest and 363 barrels from Ankor).<br />
						As more trading volume is expected with the sizable growth, KNOC will focus on
						nurturing traders and set up professional trading organizations to enhance efficiency of

						To make Korea an oil hub in the Northeast Asia, as the first step, KNOC plans to break
						the ground in the early 2011 to construct additional oil storage tanks with a capacity of
						8.2 million barrels in Yeosu and run the tanks commercially from the latter half of 2012.<br />
						Building tanks with a capacity of 28.4 million barrels in Ulsan is the second phase, the
						Ulsan project is waiting a relevant legislation being passed.
