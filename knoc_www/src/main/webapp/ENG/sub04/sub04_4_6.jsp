	               		KNOC aims at accident and disaster free operations at its
						every work sites by adhering to International Health, Safety
						and Environmental Standards. <br />In addition to ISO 9001
						and ISO 14001 certificates for work sites, KNOC acquired a
						KOSHA18001 certification for stockpile bases and an ISO 9001
						Certification for rig operations, as well as an ISM/ISPS Codes.<br />
						KNOC monitors and reduces water, air and soil pollutants at
						all stages, from planning to storage. <br />This includes guarding
						against marine pollution during receipt and transfer of stored
						oil. <br />KNOC operates state-of-the-art pollution-prevention
						facilities for water, air and soil, suitable for all petroleum
						storage methods, whether underground caverns or aboveground
						tanks. With regard to water-quality control, its inhouse
						standards for effluents exceed the statutory limit by
						75% (based on Chemical Oxygen Demand, or COD).<br />
						In addition, to comply proactively with the government's ¡°Low
						Carbon, Green Growth¡± policy, KNOC has initiated its own lowcarbon,
						green-growth action plans, with three major drives:
						a green-growth R&D projects expansion; policy responses to
						climate changes; and improvements in energy efficiency. It
						is also implementing development plans for technology to
						control pollution from fossil fuels, such as GTL (Gas To Liquids)
						and CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage). <br />KNOC is also working
						on activating infrastructure to respond to climate change,
						establishing a greenhouse gas inventory, improving energy
						efficiency and developing wind and sun power generations.<br />
						For efficient HSE (Health, Safety, and Environment)
						management system fitting global oil company standard,
						the Corporation organized a task force team to set and revise
						the HSE direction, manual and framework and presented 50
						best practices.<br /> KNOC is committed to continual improvement
						and monitoring of HSE management system to create safe
						exploration environment at home and abroad.<br />
						Recently, ANKOR Energy, operated by KNOC, received a Safety
						Award for Excellences (SAFE) from the Minerals Management
						Service (MMS), a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Interior
						in recognition of reducing the accident rate by a fifth over
						the pre-acquisition period, despite full operation and tough
						environmental conditions. KNOC, as a frontrunner of the
						domestic economy, will continue to fulfill its responsibilities to
						cherish people, nature and environment.

	               		KNOC is practicing company-wide and systematic social
						contribution activities in four core areas: supports for the
						underprivileged, contribution to regional communities,
						overseas social contribution and sponsorships for art and
						culture events.<br />
						Since KNOC Volunteer Service Corps was launched in March
						2006 under a slogan ¡°We, Explore & Volunteer.¡± 33 teams
						have been providing a broad array of voluntary activities to
						promote the welfare of the communities throughout the
						nation.<br /> Through joint social contribution activities between
						main and branch offices, KNOC is devoted to charity for
						underprivileged neighbors, such as free coal briquette
						delivery during winter seasons, and voluntary work during
						the busy agricultural seasons of rice-planting and harvesting.<br />
						KNOC's social contributions have been also extended to
						cover scholarship programs for teenagers, the ¡°One Company-
						One School Sisterhood Program¡±, multicultural family support,
						as well as events such as ¡°Rice of Love¡± and ¡°Kimchi sharing¡±
						events. To ensure a more professional approach to social
						contribution and expand opportunities into related areas,
						KNOC is carrying out joint programs with NGOs such as World
						Together and Habitat for Humanity Korea.<br />
						KNOC also makes socially responsible contributions in
						overseas countries. <br />KNOC built an elementary school in
						underprivileged area in Vietnam and supported medical
						treatment and made efforts to eradicate poverty jointly with
						the Yemen government. And in Kazakhstan, KNOC aided
						constructing railroads and donated wheelchairs for the
						disabled.<br />
						The socially responsible activities started from executives and
						employees¡¯ conviction and voluntary participation. In 2010,
						the number of employees who participated in volunteering
						work rose by 20% to 2,190 and the volunteering time rose by
						62% to as much as 10,009 hours.<br />
						KNOC will remain committed to fulfilling its social
						responsibility through continuing social contribution activities
						and to obtaining respect and affection from the communities
						it belongs to.

	               		The Corporation modified its own code of ethics and
						guidelines to set a global standard and strengthened ethical
						management training to become a widely respected public
						company.<br />
						In 2010, KNOC introduced ¡°One-Strike¡± eviction policy which
						is designed to immediately dismiss improper employees
						who are accused of taking bribes. <br />And it greatly raised the
						compensation for a whistleblower from KRW 10 million to
						KRW 2 billion maximum and whistleblower protection policy
						was also created, taking disciplinary action for those who
						leaked the identity of the whistleblower.<br />
						Following the dedication to the ethical management, when
						Anti-Corruption & Civil Rights Commission assessed the level
						of integrity of public organizations in October, KNOC ranked
						3rd out of 21 companies, gaining 9.18 points (rose from 7.34
						points in 2009), and topped in terms of integrity improvement.
						Meanwhile, KNOC was awarded the top grade (¡°AAA ¡±) by
						KoBEX SM, whereby KNOC laid a cornerstone of transparent
						management.

	               		KNOC is committed to making enterprise-wide efforts to build
						advanced management system and better the corporate
						culture to be a world-class corporation.<br />
						KNOC introduced performance-based compensation system
						applicable for the entire employees in 2010, which was the
						first case as a public company in Korea. <br />KNOC has reinforced
						KPI (Key Performance Indicators), MBO-based (Management
						By Objectives) evaluation and the according compensation
						system to improve the corporate fundamentals to be based
						on capability and performance. <br />In addition, it is making
						efforts to carry out the government plans for advancement
						with efficient organizational management policies such
						as reorganization based on region and repositioning of
						employees so that the majority of workers work at core
						business sector, and by strengthening capability of core
						business areas.<br />
						To build advanced labor relations based on law and principle,
						KNOC introduced ¡°Open-Shop¡±, ¡°Time-off ¡± policies and
						renewed collective agreement. This started from recognition
						from the both sides, the management and the labor, global
						management is a must after the string of successful global
						M&As. More than that, the agreement was possible because
						the leaders of the both sides set an exemplary model and the
						both had confidence in each other.<br />
						In terms of business management, KNOC established
						Enterprise-wide Risk Management (ERM) at a global level to
						detect risk in advance, and expanded the ERP system linking
						the network between HQ and overseas offices.<br />
						As KNOC believes collaboration and knowledge-sharing are
						the main drives for major E&P company, it established and
						expanded CoP(Community of Practice) ¡°Dagachi¡±, to integrate
						and share knowledge from overseas companies resulting
						from M&A and organizational expansion.
