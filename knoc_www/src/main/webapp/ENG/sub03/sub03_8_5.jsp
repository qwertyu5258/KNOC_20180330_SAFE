													<p>CCS (Carbon capture and storage) is a technology that captured CO©ü from the power plants is transferred and stored underground. This technology, which prevents emissions from entering the atmosphere, provides an active way for coping with climate change. The Korean government has shown its determination to develop the technology so far. Considering this and the technology¡¯s potential as a future business, KNOC created a task force in 2010 to facilitate technology advancement. Also, it has carried out government-assigned research projects in the storage area.</p>
													<br />
													<p>Thanks to its accumulated technologies and knowhow in oil exploration and development, KNOC played a leading role in CCS technology such as G&G area, petroleum engineering area and topside plant design area. Major research projects currently underway include exploration of suitable storage sites in the offshore basins of Korea, assessment of storage capacity, prediction of CO©ü migration around potential onshore storage sites and process engineering design. Furthermore, Technology development department was already involved in an integrated CCS demonstration project in Canada. This provides the institute a benchmarking opportunity regarding necessary technologies and conditions for its own CCS demonstration in the future. Based on the outcomes of all these, KNOC is now carrying out a small-scale demonstration government project from 2013. Our goal is to commercialize CCS technology from 2020.</p>
													<br />
													<p>KNOC is committed to the advancement of the technology, considering CCS as one of its next-generation growth engines. KNOC is a national company which aims to develop hydrocarbon fuels, the major source of CO©ü emissions. Therefore, it is meaningful for the company to strive to reduce CO©ü emissions in terms of corporate responsibility and contribution to society.</p>
