KNOC has demonstrated a remarkable growth for recent three years by 
being very proactive in acquiring oversea oil companies and assets as 
well as expanding investments in overseas E&P projects. We aim to 
achieve the daily production capacity of 500 thousand barrels by 2017, 
which will be promoted by actively consolidating the overseas business. 
On the domestic side, based on the oil stockpiling facilities with the 
capacity of 1.46 million barrels, KNOC focuses not only on expanding the 
international joint-stockpile business with oil-producing countries and 
global oil majors but also on implementing the business to help the nation 
play a key role as a hub of the Northeast Asian oil trading market." width="412" height="238" /></td>
