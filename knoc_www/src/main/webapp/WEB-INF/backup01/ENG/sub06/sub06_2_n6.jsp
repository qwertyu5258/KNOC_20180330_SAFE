										<p>Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a technology that can capture CO2 emissions from power plants, steelworks, and other large-sized workplaces, and then transport and store them underground. The technology, which prevents emissions from entering the atmosphere, provides an active way for coping with climate change. The Korean government has shown its determination to develop the technology so far. Considering this and the technology¡¯s potential as a future business, EPTI created a task force in 2010 to facilitate technology advancement. Also, it has carried out government-assigned research projects in the storage area.</p><br />
										<p>Thanks to its accumulated technologies and knowhow in oil exploration and development, EPTI has played a leading role in CCS technology development at home. Major research projects currently underway include exploration of suitable storage sites in the offshore basins of Korea, assessment of storage capacity, and prediction of CO2 migration around potential onshore storage sites. Furthermore, the institute is now involved in an integrated CCS demonstration project in Canada. This provides the institute a benchmarking opportunity regarding necessary technologies and conditions for its own CCS demonstration in the future. Based on the outcomes of all these, EPTI will carry out a medium-scale, 100,000-ton integrated demonstration from 2013 and a large-scale, 1 million-ton integrated demonstration from 2015. Commercial storage of CO2 will become possible from 2020.</p><br />
										<p>EPTI is committed to the advancement of the technology, considering CCS as one of its next-generation growth engines. KNOC is a national company which aims to develop hydrocarbon fuels, the major source of CO2 emissions. Therefore, it is meaningful for the company to strive to reduce CO2 emissions in terms of corporate responsibility and contribution to society.</p>
