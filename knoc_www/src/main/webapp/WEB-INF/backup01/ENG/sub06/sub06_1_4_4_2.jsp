          <p>Drilling Team, which is comprised of drilling experts, is engaged in planning of work, designing wells, supervising drilling 
operations and developing new drilling technologies. It also provides manpower for the planning review and drilling support 
of joint operation or non-operating blocks. It is conducting internal and external technical seminars and OJT programs to 
train inexperienced personnel.  In order to standardize the drilling operations and technology, the Drilling Team is also 
engaged in enacting and revising the instructions and guidelines related to drilling standards and health &amp; safety 
environment.    </p>
<p>Drilling procedures require application of different methods and technology depending on drilling environment, well location, 
topography, geological features, logistic supply base, etc. The Drilling Team makes a drilling program to successfully 
complete the operation within the planned time and budget by consideration of complex and diverse formation features and 
applying the new technology for the safe and effective operation. 
</p> 

<p>When planning the drilling operation, it conducts technical analysis on casing selection, setting depth, drilling mud, 
cementing, drilling bits and well trajectory.  The team also makes a plan for crew change, transportation of material, and 
communication. In case of land operation, additional consideration is required for accessibility. Various domestic and 
overseas technical training programs are managed and procedures and standards for securing world-class drilling technologies 
and SHE standards are revised as well by Drilling Team. 
 </p>

<p>Drilling Team has successfully completed drilling operations in offshore Korea and overseas including Algeria, Canada, 
Indonesia, Kazakhstan, North Offshore of U.K., Russia, Vietnam and Yemen. Currently, it is involved in drilling operation in 
Canada, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Korea and Vietnam and Yemen to supervise the drilling operations and provide highly qualified 
technical support. In addition, the team is also preparing for upcoming operations in Uzbekistan.</p>

<p>The advent of resource nationalism and extreme competition surrounding resource development resulted in the shift of 
operation sites to Polar Regions and to even back country. Furthermore, the increasing need for developing alternative energy 
such as gas hydrate and oil sand demand new technology that can be applied to more complicated and diversified operation 
sites. </p>

<p>Drilling Team has made enormous efforts to efficiently address the dynamic situation related to petroleum development and to 
improve our competitiveness in the international arena. Furthermore, the team has been putting more emphasis on technology 
for developing unconventional energy resources such as oil sand, oil shale, gas hydrate, and geothermal energy.
