						The takeover also provided with opportunities to expand its core

						The center will play an advisory role in providing technical
						assessment when making major decisions for new business.<br /> And it
						will advise when deciding a drilling location in exploration blocks.
						The center will contribute to raising exploration success rate,
						securing additional reserves and augmenting production volume.<br />
						In addition, it will sharpen technological edge in petroleum geology,
						geophysics, reservoir engineering and production engineering and
						will focus on promising fields of work that will bear fruit in the future
						by selecting 6 strategic technologies such as regional geology,
						imaging underground structures and enhanced oil recovery (EOR),

						linking R&D with nearby blocks where KNOC is operating.

	               		Under the government¡¯s mid- and long-term oil stockpiling plan,
						3-phases of stockpiling facility construction starting from 1980 was
						completed in last April 2010. <br />Three series of large-scale national
						construction projects began in 1995 and was finalized in 2010,
						costing KRW 1.4 trillion, 2.11 million experts & technicians, and a great
						volume of steel plates enormous enough to build 10 Eiffel Towers.
						Under the 1st and 2nd oil stockpiling plans from 1980 to 1999, KNOC
						constructed 7 bases in Guri, Ulsan, Pyungtaek and other provincial
						areas with reserves of 95 million barrels of oil. It was followed by the
						3rd stockpiling plan starting from July 1995, reserving 50 million
						barrels in 6 bases in Geoje, Yeosu, Ulsan, and other areas, reaching
						146 million barrels of total reserve capacity. It is equivalent to 158
						days of net imports, surpassing the 90-day standard which is the
						requirement for IEA (International Energy Agency) member countries.<br />
						Including private reserve volume, KNOC has secured 176 million
						barrels of oil (equivalent to 193 days as of January 2011), contributing
						to international assistance and stable oil supply and demand at
						home. Of the total reserves, KNOC has gained on valuation for 82
						million barrels of reserves compared to the initial purchasing price.<br />
						This stockpiling program will contribute to creating jobs and relevant
						industries¡¯ development.

						The Forum was the first hosted by KNOC aiming at strengthening
						Asia-NOC cooperative relations. Its main purpose is to maintain and
						develop reciprocal partnership among Asia NOCs.<br />
						Under the theme, ¡°Asian NOCs toward Humanity, Environment and
						Energy,¡± NOC CEOs from 12 organizations (10 national oil companies,
						2 government agencies) in 8 countries and 100 local companies
						involving with overseas resource development attended the forum.<br />
						The forum was in line with government¡¯s initiatives, ¡®¡®the New Asia
						Initiative,¡±, and ¡°the Energy Diplomacy Initiative¡± seeking to upgrade
						Korea's role as a power player in Asia by engaging the region and
						creating stronger ties with Asian NOCs. The international occasion
						to discuss energy cooperation ties was supported by the Ministry of
						Knowledge Economy and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade as
						well as the Energy & Mineral Resources Development Association of
						Korea (EMRD) in which KNOC is taking the chair.<br />
						KNOC, through the meeting, laid the foundation for upgraded
						international competitiveness of Korea, maintaining and developing its
						partnership with Asian NOCs which will lead the world economy.
